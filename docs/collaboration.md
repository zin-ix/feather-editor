# Collaborative Editing

**Feather Editor** (the most lightweight rich text editor) ships an **opt-in, real-time collaborative editing** layer (in `collab/`) built on [Yjs](https://github.com/yjs/yjs) CRDTs. Multiple users edit the same document concurrently — over a network or in-process — with live presence, comments, and tracked-change suggestions. The core editor stays dependency-free; the collaboration layer's dependencies (`yjs`, `y-protocols`, `y-websocket`, `y-indexeddb`, `ws`) are dev/server-only.

- **[Server & deployment →](./collaboration-server.md)** — running the reference server, auth, persistence, scaling

## What you get

| Capability | Module | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Conflict-free co-editing** | `paragraph-binding.js` | Yjs ⇄ DOM binding; convergence under concurrent edits |
| **Block coverage** | `schema.js` | paragraphs, headings, lists, blockquote, code, image, table, callout |
| **All inline marks** | `schema.js` | bold/italic/underline/strike/code/link (href sanitized) |
| **Live presence** | `presence.js` | remote carets, selection highlights, typing, roster |
| **Comments** | `comments.js` + `comments-ui.js` | threaded, anchored, resolve, orphan handling |
| **Suggestions / tracked changes** | `suggestions.js` + `suggestion-mode.js` | type/paste/range, per-author color, accept-reject |
| **Networked transport** | `provider.js` + `server/collab-server.mjs` | WebSocket provider + reference server (auth, reconnect) |
| **In-process transport** | `memory-hub.js` | stand-in for demos/tests; offline pause/resume |
| **Offline persistence** | `providers/indexeddb.js` | local-first load + survives reloads |

Everything is verified at the unit (Vitest + happy-dom) and real-browser (Playwright) levels.

## Quick start

A single editor synced over the network:

```js
import * as Y from 'yjs';
import { WebSocketProvider }   from './collab/provider.js';
import { bindParagraphSpike }  from './collab/paragraph-binding.js';
import { bindPresence }        from './collab/presence.js';
import { persistLocally }      from './collab/providers/indexeddb.js';

const doc = new Y.Doc();

// 1. Transport — connect to a sync server (see server docs).
const provider = new WebSocketProvider('ws://localhost:1234', 'my-doc', doc, {
  params: { token: authToken },         // optional: read by the server's authorize() hook
});

// 2. (Optional) local-first persistence — hydrate before binding.
const local = persistLocally(doc, 'my-doc');
await local.whenSynced;

// 3. Bind the editor's DOM to the Yjs document.
bindParagraphSpike(editor, doc);

// 4. Presence — your cursor/selection broadcast to peers.
bindPresence(editor, doc, provider.awareness, { name: 'Alice', color: '#2563eb' });

// 5. (Optional) connection-status UI.
provider.onStatus(({ status, lastSynced }) => renderStatus(status, lastSynced));
```

`editor` is a Feather Editor `Editor` instance. The binding seeds the Yjs document from the editor's current DOM the first time, or renders the document into the editor if it already has content (e.g. restored from IndexedDB or a peer).

For local development without a server, swap the transport for the in-process [`MemoryHub`](./collaboration-api.md#memoryhub):

```js
import { MemoryHub } from './collab/memory-hub.js';
const hub = new MemoryHub();
hub.connect(docA, awarenessA);
hub.connect(docB, awarenessB);   // docA and docB now stay in sync in one page
```

## Architecture

The layers, from transport up to UI:

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  UI helpers      presence.js · comments-ui.js · suggestion-mode.js │
├──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Binding         paragraph-binding.js   (Yjs Doc ⇄ editor DOM) │
│  Schema          schema.js              (DOM ⇄ model mapping)  │
│  Domain stores   comments.js · suggestions.js                 │
├──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Transport       provider.js (WebSocket) · memory-hub.js       │
│  Persistence     providers/indexeddb.js                        │
├──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  CRDT            Yjs Doc + y-protocols Awareness               │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Separation of concerns:**

- **Transport** is abstracted behind a `CollabProvider` contract (`doc`, `awareness`, `synced`, `status`, `connect/disconnect/destroy`, `on/off`). The binding and UI never know whether they're on a WebSocket or in-memory.
- **The schema** (`schema.js`) is the single declarative source of truth for the DOM ⇄ model mapping. Adding a mark or block type is a data change there, not edits scattered through the binding.
- **The binding** (`paragraph-binding.js`) keeps the Yjs document and the contenteditable DOM in sync, both directions, with minimal DOM churn and caret preservation.
- **Presence** lives on **ephemeral Awareness**, off the document — so cursors never enter the undo history or the saved content.
- **Comments** live in a separate `Y.Array`, anchored to text via RelativePositions. **Suggestions** are formatting marks on the block text.

---

## The document model

The document is a flat array of blocks:

```
doc.getArray('blocks')   →  Y.Array<Y.Map>
doc.getArray('comments') →  Y.Array<Y.Map>   (comment threads)
```

Each block is a `Y.Map`. Its shape depends on its **kind** (declared in `schema.js`):

| Kind | Types | Fields |
|---|---|---|
| `text` | `p`, `h1`–`h6`, `blockquote`, `li`, `pre`, `cell` | `id`, `type`, `text: Y.Text` (+ `listType` for `li`; `tableId`/`r`/`c`/`header` for `cell`) |
| `atomic` | `image` | `id`, `type`, `data: { … }` (no editable text) |
| `wrapped` | `callout` | `id`, `type`, `text: Y.Text`, `emoji`, `color` (editable body + decoration) |

Key design choices:

- **Stable `data-id` keys.** Every block element carries a `data-id`. Concurrent insert/delete/reorder reconciles **by id**, so a peer's edit follows its block even as others restructure around it.
- **Inline marks are Yjs text-formatting attributes** on a block's `Y.Text` (see `MARKS` in `schema.js`). Render precedence is the array order (outermost first).
- **Lists and tables expand to per-item blocks.** A `<ul>`/`<ol>` becomes one `li` block per item; a `<table>` becomes one `cell` block per `<td>/<th>` (carrying its `tableId` + row/col). They regroup into the container element on render. This is what makes **per-cell concurrent editing** possible.
- **Caret preservation uses RelativePositions** captured in `doc.on('beforeTransaction')` — *before* a remote change integrates — then resolved back to an absolute index after the patch.
- **Minimal DOM patching.** Remote changes reuse existing block elements by `data-id` and patch inline content at the run level (only changed runs are replaced), so unchanged blocks/runs — and any live selection inside them — are never touched.

## Features in depth

### Presence (`bindPresence`)

Broadcasts your user identity, cursor, selection range, and typing state over **ephemeral Awareness** (auto-expires when you go quiet — no tombstones in the doc). Renders remote carets, selection-range highlights, and name labels in an overlay layer *outside* the editable tree (never in `getHtml()`). The `onChange` callback yields the roster for your own UI. Author names render via `textContent` (escaped).

### Comments (`CommentStore` + `bindCommentsUI`)

Threaded comments in `doc.getArray('comments')`, each anchored to a text range within a block via two RelativePositions. Anchors follow the text under concurrent edits; if the anchored text is deleted, the thread is reported `orphaned` rather than rendering a zero-width highlight. `bindCommentsUI` draws range highlights in an overlay and creates threads from the current selection.

### Suggestions / tracked changes (`SuggestionStore` + `bindSuggestionMode`)

A tracked change is a `suggestion: { id, type, author, color? }` formatting attribute on the block text:

- **insert** — proposed text is inserted and marked (rendered underlined); accept keeps it, reject removes it.
- **delete** — the range is marked (rendered struck-through, **kept** until resolved); accept removes it, reject keeps it.

`bindSuggestionMode` intercepts `beforeinput`/`paste` when enabled: typing, backspace, **selection delete/replace**, and **paste** all become tracked changes. Each author's changes render in their **presence color** (insert/delete distinguished by *decoration*, so color is never the only signal). Accept/reject (and accept-all/reject-all) live on `SuggestionStore` and sync to all peers.

### Offline / local-first (`persistLocally`)

Wraps `y-indexeddb` so a document loads instantly from the local cache before any network sync and survives reloads. Pattern: `await persist.whenSynced`, then seed fresh content only if the doc is empty. Offline edits merge cleanly on reconnect (CRDT).

### Transport & resilience (`WebSocketProvider`)

Wraps the `y-websocket` client (auto-reconnect with exponential backoff). Adds a derived `status` (`connecting` / `connected` / `reconnecting` / `disconnected`), `lastSynced`, and `onStatus(cb)` for a connection-status UI. See the [server docs](./collaboration-server.md) for the matching reference server and the `authorize()` hook.

## Testing

| Command | What it covers |
|---|---|
| `npm test` | Unit suite (Vitest + happy-dom): convergence, marks, block types, comments, suggestions, transport, reconnect, auth |
| `npm run test:e2e` | Real-browser (Playwright): IME/paste, IndexedDB reload, suggestion mode |

The collab tests live in `tests/collab-*.test.js` and `tests/e2e/collab-*.mjs`.

## Limitations & future work

- **Tables** — nested tables are not supported; `colspan`/`rowspan` and *concurrent* row/column modifications are coordinated by coordinates.
- **Suggestion mode** — range operations and paste are single-block scoped; multi-block range operations fall back to direct edit.
- **The reference server** is a reference implementation. It includes an `authorize()` hook and standard room handling; hosts bring persistence or pub/sub scaling as needed.
