**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it privately using one of these methods:

1. **GitHub Private Reporting** *(preferred)* — go to the **Security** tab on the repository and click **"Report a vulnerability"**
2. **Email** — contact the maintainers directly via security@feathereditor.dev

Please include as much of the following as possible:

- A clear description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue (proof-of-concept if possible)
- The potential impact (what could an attacker do?)
- Any suggested mitigations you have in mind

You will receive an acknowledgement within **48 hours** and a more detailed response within **7 days** indicating the next steps. We aim to release a patch within **30 days** of a confirmed vulnerability.

We kindly ask that you give us reasonable time to address the issue before any public disclosure.

## 🔐 Security Design

Feather Editor is a **client-side rich text editor** that accepts, renders, and outputs HTML. Here is how we handle the main attack surface:

### HTML Sanitization

All pasted HTML passes through `sanitize()` in `src/utils/html.js` before being inserted into the DOM. This function:

- **Strips all attributes** not on an explicit allowlist (`href`, `src`, `alt`, `class`, `style`, `colspan`, `rowspan`, and internal `data-*` attributes)
- **Rejects dangerous URL schemes** in `href` and `src`: `javascript:`, `vbscript:`, and `data:text/html` (with whitespace and null-byte stripping to prevent bypass)
- **Strips inline styles** that contain `javascript:` expressions (e.g. `url(javascript:...)`)

### URL Validation

The `setLink` command in `src/core/Editor.js` validates every href before touching the DOM, using the same dangerous-protocol check as the sanitizer.

The `Link` extension (`src/extensions/marks/Link.js`) also validates the URL entered via the prompt before calling `setLink`.

### Content Security

- Feather Editor does **not** use `eval()`, `Function()`, or `innerHTML` on untrusted content without sanitization.
- Feather Editor does **not** make network requests except through user-supplied hooks (such as custom `uploadImage` handlers).
- The `print()` method uses a dedicated print frame / window for clean, safe document printing.

### Known Limitations

- `style` attributes are allowed on the allowlist (required for text colour, background, etc.). Style-based injection via `expression(...)` is blocked, but complex CSS injection through allowed `style` values is a known trade-off. We do not execute server-side rendering.
- `document.execCommand()` is used for certain inline formatting operations for robust cross-browser behavior in contenteditable environments.
